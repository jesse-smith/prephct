# prephct

`{prephct}` contains helper functions to prepare for event prediction in the
MLinHCT data. It is currently focused on handling St. Jude data, with an eye
towards other datasets in the future.

## Installation

To install prephct, you will need to be able to build R packages. On Windows,
this means you will need to have a version of 
[RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ "RTools: Toolchains for building R and R packages from source on Windows") 
installed that is compatible with the R version you are using. You can install 
the development version of `{prephct}` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jesse-smith/prephct")
```

In the near future, this should be replaced by an 
[R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/ "R-universe: personal package repositories for R!") 
repository, which will remove the need to use Rtools on Windows.
